# NoCheatMinus
 This is a recode/port of an AntiCheat in Vanilla Minecraft, that existed back in 2016,  as a Datapack for Minecraft 1.16.4. Its purpose is the detection of generic game modifications by checking and tracking movement, fight and network behavior of players constantly, followed by a configurable comparison of the collected data with the expected behavior.
